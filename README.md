## ‚úçÔ∏è Overview

-  **ReSim** is a driving world model that enables **Re**liable
**Sim**ulation of diverse open-world driving scenarios under various actions, including hazardous non-expert ones. A **Video2Reward** model estimates the reward from ReSim‚Äôs simulated future. 


- The key ingredient is to co-train the world model on heterogeneous driving data including driving videos from the web, driving data with action labels, and simulated data with non-expert driving behaviors.

- The high-fidelity prediction, accurate action-following, and reward estimation abilities of ReSim facilitate
multiple driving applications. 



## üìã TODO List

- [ ] Code release (Estimated in July).
- [ ] Pretrained weights for ReSim world model.
- [ ] Simulated data from CARLA with non-expert behaviors.
